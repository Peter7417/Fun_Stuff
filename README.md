# Fun_Stuff

A simple Python script to read downloaded data from https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm.
The user will have to unzip the data downloaded from the site and place it in a folder along with the code.
The script will parse data from the text file to find a specific ticker provided by the user and produce a list of data matching your ticker search.


Remember to save the python file and the extracted data in the same folder/library.
Run the program on CMD/Terminal or on an IDE.
Type in the name of the extracted file(rename it to make things easier if you wish)
Type in the stock ticker you want to search.
The script will produce data to match your ticker or will error out if you type an invalid ticker.
Have fun!!!
